                We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>
                And in spring too I feel no different.<br>
                We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>
                through much dark-red loss, appellation control√©e,<br><br>

                that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>
                We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>
                Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees <br>
                sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br><br>

                33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>
                of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>
                at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br><br>

                Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>
                The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>
                The here is nowhere, and the now is never.<br><br>
